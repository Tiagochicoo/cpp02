# Chapter I

# Introduction

_C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an ex-
tension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes" (source: Wikipedia)._

The goal of these modules is to introduce you to **Object-Oriented Programming**.
This will be the starting point of your C++ journey. Many languages are recommended
to learn OOP. We decided to choose C++ since it’s derived from your old friend C.
Because this is a complex language, and in order to keep things simple, your code will
comply with the C++98 standard.
We are aware modern C++ is way different in a lot of aspects. So if you want to
become a proficient C++ developer, it’s up to you to go further after the 42 Common
Core!


# Chapter II

# General rules

**Compiling**

- Compile your code withc++and the flags-Wall -Wextra -Werror
- Your code should still compile if you add the flag-std=c++

```
Formatting and naming conventions
```
- The exercise directories will be named this way:ex00, ex01, ... , exn
- Name your files, classes, functions, member functions and attributes as required in
    the guidelines.
- Write class names in **UpperCamelCase** format. Files containing class code will
    always be named according to the class name. For instance:
    ClassName.hpp/ClassName.h,ClassName.cpp, orClassName.tpp. Then, if you
    have a header file containing the definition of a class "BrickWall" standing for a
    brick wall, its name will beBrickWall.hpp.
- Unless specified otherwise, every output messages must be ended by a new-line
    character and displayed to the standard output.
- _Goodbye Norminette!_ No coding style is enforced in the C++ modules. You can
    follow your favorite one. But keep in mind that a code your peer-evaluators can’t
    understand is a code they can’t grade. Do your best to write a clean and readable
    code.

```
Allowed/Forbidden
```
```
You are not coding in C anymore. Time to C++! Therefore:
```
- You are allowed to use almost everything from the standard library. Thus, instead
    of sticking to what you already know, it would be smart to use as much as possible
    the C++-ish versions of the C functions you are used to.
- However, you can’t use any other external library. It means C++11 (and derived
    forms) andBoostlibraries are forbidden. The following functions are forbidden
    too:*printf(),*alloc()andfree(). If you use them, your grade will be 0 and
    that’s it.


C++ - Module 02

```
Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading
and Orthodox Canonical class form
```
- Note that unless explicitly stated otherwise, theusing namespace <ns_name>and
    friendkeywords are forbidden. Otherwise, your grade will be -42.
- **You are allowed to use the STL in the Module 08 and 09 only.** That means:
    no **Containers** (vector/list/map/and so forth) and no **Algorithms** (anything that
    requires to include the<algorithm>header) until then. Otherwise, your grade will
    be -42.

```
A few design requirements
```
- Memory leakage occurs in C++ too. When you allocate memory (by using thenew
    keyword), you must avoid **memory leaks**.
- From Module 02 to Module 09, your classes must be designed in the **Orthodox**
    **Canonical Form, except when explicitely stated otherwise**.
- Any function implementation put in a header file (except for function templates)
    means 0 to the exercise.
- You should be able to use each of your headers independently from others. Thus,
    they must include all the dependencies they need. However, you must avoid the
    problem of double inclusion by adding **include guards**. Otherwise, your grade will
    be 0.

```
Read me
```
- You can add some additional files if you need to (i.e., to split your code). As these
    assignments are not verified by a program, feel free to do so as long as you turn in
    the mandatory files.
- Sometimes, the guidelines of an exercise look short but the examples can show
    requirements that are not explicitly written in the instructions.
- Read each module completely before starting! Really, do it.
- By Odin, by Thor! Use your brain!!!

```
You will have to implement a lot of classes. This can seem tedious,
unless you’re able to script your favorite text editor.
```
```
You are given a certain amount of freedom to complete the exercises.
However, follow the mandatory rules and don’t be lazy. You would
miss a lot of useful information! Do not hesitate to read about
theoretical concepts.
```

# Chapter III

# New rules

From now on, all your classes must be designed in the **Orthodox Canonical Form** ,
unless explicitely stated otherwise. Then, they will implement the four required member
functions below:

- Default constructor
- Copy constructor
- Copy assignment operator
- Destructor

Split your class code into two files. The header file (.hpp/.h) contains the class
definition whereas the source file (.cpp) contains the implementation.


# Chapter IV

# Exercise 00: My First Class in

# Orthodox Canonical Form

```
Exercise : 00
```
```
My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form
Turn-in directory : ex 00 /
Files to turn in :Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp
Forbidden functions :None
```
```
You think you know integers and floating-point numbers. How cute.
```
```
Please read this 3 pages article (1, 2, 3) to discover that you don’t. Go on, read it.
```
Until today, every number you used in your code was basically either an integer or a
floating-point number, or any of their variants (short,char,long,double, and so forth).
After reading the article above, it’s safe to assume that integers and floating-point num-
bers have opposite caracteristics.

But today, things will change. You are going to discover a new and awesome number
type: **fixed-point numbers**! Forever missing from the scalar types of most languages,
fixed-point numbers offer a valuable balance between performance, accuracy, range and
precision. That explains why fixed-point numbers are particularly applicable to computer
graphics, sound processing or scientific programming, just to name a few.

As C++ lacks fixed-point numbers, you’re going to add them. This article from
Berkeley is a good start. If you have no idea what Berkeley University is, read this
section of its Wikipedia page.


C++ - Module 02

```
Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading
and Orthodox Canonical class form
```
```
Create a class in Orthodox Canonical Form that represents a fixed-point number:
```
- Private members:

```
◦ An integer to store the fixed-point number value.
◦ A static constant integer to store the number of fractional bits. Its value
will always be the integer literal 8.
```
- Public members:

```
◦ A default constructor that initializes the fixed-point number value to 0.
◦ A copy constructor.
◦ A copy assignment operator overload.
◦ A destructor.
◦ A member functionint getRawBits( void ) const;
that returns the raw value of the fixed-point value.
◦ A member functionvoid setRawBits( int const raw );
that sets the raw value of the fixed-point number.
```
```
Running this code:
```
```
#include <iostream>
int main( void ) {
Fixed a;
Fixed b( a );
Fixed c;
c = b;
std::cout << a.getRawBits() << std::endl;
std::cout << b.getRawBits() << std::endl;
std::cout << c.getRawBits() << std::endl;
return 0;
}
```
```
Should output something similar to:
$> ./a.out
Default constructor called
Copy constructor called
Copy assignment operator called // <-- This line may be missing depending on your implementation
getRawBits member function called
Default constructor called
Copy assignment operator called
getRawBits member function called
getRawBits member function called
0
getRawBits member function called

getRawBits member function called

Destructor called

$>
```

# Chapter V

# Exercise 01: Towards a more useful

# fixed-point number class

```
Exercise 01
```
```
Towards a more useful fixed-point number class
Turn-in directory : ex 01 /
Files to turn in :Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp
Allowed functions :roundf (from <cmath>)
```
The previous exercise was a good start but our class is pretty useless. It can only
represent the value0.0.

```
Add the following public constructors and public member functions to your class:
```
- A constructor that takes a **constant integer** as a parameter.
    It converts it to the corresponding fixed-point value. The fractional bits value is
    initialized to 8 like in exercise 00.
- A constructor that takes a **constant floating-point number** as a parameter.
    It converts it to the corresponding fixed-point value. The fractional bits value is
    initialized to 8 like in exercise 00.
- A member functionfloat toFloat( void ) const;
    that converts the fixed-point value to a floating-point value.
- A member functionint toInt( void ) const;
    that converts the fixed-point value to an integer value.

```
And add the following function to the Fixed class files:
```
- An overload of the insertion («) operator that inserts a floating-point representation
    of the fixed-point number into the output stream object passed as parameter.

Running this code:
```
```
#include <iostream>
int main( void ) {
Fixed a;
Fixed const b( 10 );
Fixed const c( 42.42f );
Fixed const d( b );
a = Fixed( 1234.4321f );
std::cout << "a is " << a << std::endl;
std::cout << "b is " << b << std::endl;
std::cout << "c is " << c << std::endl;
std::cout << "d is " << d << std::endl;
std::cout << "a is " << a.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
std::cout << "b is " << b.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
std::cout << "c is " << c.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
std::cout << "d is " << d.toInt() << " as integer" << std::endl;
return 0;
}
```
```
Should output something similar to:
$> ./a.out
Default constructor called
Int constructor called
Float constructor called
Copy constructor called
Copy assignment operator called
Float constructor called
Copy assignment operator called
Destructor called
a is 1234.
b is 10
c is 42.
d is 10
a is 1234 as integer
b is 10 as integer
c is 42 as integer
d is 10 as integer

```
Exercise 02
```
```
Now we’re talking
Turn-in directory : ex 02 /
Files to turn in :Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp
Allowed functions :roundf (from <cmath>)
```
```
Add public member functions to your class to overload the following operators:
```
- The 6 comparison operators:>,<,>=,<=,==and!=.
- The 4 arithmetic operators:+,-,*, and/.
- The 4 increment/decrement (pre-increment and post-increment, pre-decrement and
    post-decrement) operators, that will increase or decrease the fixed-point value from
    the smallest representable _ε_ such as1 + _ε >_ 1.

```
Add these four public overloaded member functions to your class:
```
- A static member functionminthat takes as parameters two references on fixed-point
    numbers, and returns a reference to the smallest one.
- A static member functionminthat takes as parameters two references to **constant**
    fixed-point numbers, and returns a reference to the smallest one.
- A static member functionmaxthat takes as parameters two references on fixed-point
    numbers, and returns a reference to the greatest one.
- A static member functionmaxthat takes as parameters two references to **constant**
    fixed-point numbers, and returns a reference to the greatest one.


C++ - Module 02

```
Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading
and Orthodox Canonical class form
```
```
It’s up to you to test every feature of your class. However, running the code below:
```
```
#include <iostream>
int main( void ) {
Fixed a;
Fixed const b( Fixed( 5.05f ) * Fixed( 2 ) );
std::cout << a << std::endl;
std::cout << ++a << std::endl;
std::cout << a << std::endl;
std::cout << a++ << std::endl;
std::cout << a << std::endl;
std::cout << b << std::endl;
std::cout << Fixed::max( a, b ) << std::endl;
return 0;
}
```
Should output something like (for greater readability, the constructor/destructor mes-
sages are removed in the example below):

```
$> ./a.out
0
0.
0.
0.
0.
10.
10.
$>
```
```
If you ever do a division by 0, it is acceptable that the program
crashes
```

# Chapter VII

# Exercise 03: BSP

```
Exercise 03
```
```
BSP
Turn-in directory : ex 03 /
Files to turn in :Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp,
Point.{h, hpp}, Point.cpp, bsp.cpp
Allowed functions :roundf (from <cmath>)
```
```
Now that you have a functional Fixed class, it would be nice to use it.
```
Implement a function which indicates whether a point is inside of a triangle or not.
Very useful, isn’t it?

```
BSP stands for Binary space partitioning. You are welcome. :)
```
```
You can pass this module without doing exercise 03.
```

C++ - Module 02

```
Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading
and Orthodox Canonical class form
```
Let’s start by creating the class **Point** in Orthodox Canonical Form that represents
a 2D point:

- Private members:

```
◦ A Fixed const attributex.
◦ A Fixed const attributey.
◦ Anything else useful.
```
- Public members:

```
◦ A default constructor that initializesxandyto 0.
◦ A constructor that takes as parameters two constant floating-point numbers.
It initializesxandywith those parameters.
◦ A copy constructor.
◦ A copy assignment operator overload.
◦ A destructor.
◦ Anything else useful.
```
```
To conclude, implement the following function in the appropriate file:
```
```
bool bsp( Point const a, Point const b, Point const c, Point const point);
```
- a, b, c: The vertices of our beloved triangle.
- point: The point to check.
- Returns: True if the point is inside the triangle. False otherwise.
    Thus, if the point is a vertex or on edge, it will return False.

```
Implement and turn in your own tests to ensure that your class behaves as expected.
```
